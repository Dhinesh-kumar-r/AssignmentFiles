    <p>Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that
        piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in
        popular media. For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film Piranha features an oversized
        piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman. Such a terrifying representation easily captures the
        imagination and promotes unnecessary fear. While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the
        adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than
        fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</p>
